# GFood
GFood is an accessibility-focused mobile application developed using Flutter. It empowers users with restaurant choice barriers to easily select or decide on the suitable restaurant and food through user preferences and restaurant data. The app provides questionnaire, restaurant ratings and reviews, restaurant details (phone number, opening/closing schedule, location, open/closing, etc.), Wheel of Fortune, and other features that increase user independence and efficiency in choosing a restaurant.
